To mount the test layer 1 volume, use
mkdir mnt && ./onionmount test mnt # Password is "Fish"
To mount the layer 2 volume, use
mkdir mnt2 && ./onionmount mnt/keystream mnt2 # Password is Barf
If there were a layer 3 volume, you would use
mkdir mnt3 && ./onionmount mnt2/keystream mnt3 # and a third password would be needed
